# YGPatchParse
Very simple Java program to parse valid patchinfo.dat file.

patchinfo.dat is used by the official Yogurting launcher, specifically by the patching process. The launcher downloads this file to check the integrity of the file or to determine if an update is needed.



# Usage

Get a build from the [**Releases page.**](https://github.com/Winterr1337/YGPatchParse/releases/tag/Latest)

Place your .cab files in a folder named "new" and execute:
```java -jar YGPatchParse.jar ```
The program will generate the desired file in the folder where it's located.
